## Description
This is a pet portrait website I created for my girlfriend. It is a project that I have wanted to make for a while. It allows her to display and show off her artwork while letting potential customers contact her directly from the client side. I created this project with React, a Javascript framework, as well as with EmailJS, a service allowing users to email her directly from the website. Before starting its development, I had the idea of adding this capability, but didn't exactly know how to make that happen. With a bit of research and digging, I solved that problem with EmailJS. I designed the website's wireframe using Excalidraw because of its simplicity and how it enables me to build a base for my ideas quickly and efficiently. I went with a scrolling website design because of the smooth feel and thought that it would better match the overall design of the website.
